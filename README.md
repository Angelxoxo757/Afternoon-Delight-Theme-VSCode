# evening-delight README

Hello my name is Maria Cromety, I decided to make my own visual studio code theme simply because I wanted to learn something new that I haven't learned. I decided to build my own theme because I wanted my own personal theme when I'm coding. The theme I decided to make was inspired by the many joys bring me happiness simply because I love being happy. This is my first visual studio code theme I plan on building more in the future I hope you all like it.

Here are screenshots of what the theme is going to look like in your editor!
